Local reactions include redness, swelling, itching around the injection site, which usually clears up within a few days to weeks. Uncommon reactions may result in lipodystrophy (shrinkage or thickening of fatty tissue) at the injection site, which can affect insulin absorption and should be prevented by changing injection sites with each injection. Oedema (swelling) has also been reported, particularly at the start of insulin therapy or during a change in therapy.</li></ul><p>Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is a common problem for people with diabetes, which can be caused by taking too much Humalog or other insulins, missing meals, changing diet, exercising, having an infection or illness, or experiencing a change in need for insulin. Symptoms include tiredness, rapid heartbeat, nervousness or shakiness, feeling sick, headache, and cold sweat.</p><p>Hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) can be caused by not taking enough Humalog or other insulins, taking less insulin than prescribed, eating more than allowed, or experiencing fever, infection, or emotional stress. Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which requires immediate medical attention and is characterized by symptoms such as feeling sleepy, no appetite, flushed face, fruity smell on the breath, thirst, and frequent urination.</p><p>Illness can affect insulin needs, and people with diabetes should test their urine or blood, follow their "sick rules," and tell their doctor if they are ill.</p><p>Humalog should be stored in a refrigerator before first use and kept at room temperature during use, discarded after 28 days, and kept out of the sight and reach of children. It should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste.</p></div>
